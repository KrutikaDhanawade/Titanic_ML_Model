 CONCLUSION:
 
A] PREPROCESSING

    1]we can determine that the mean average age in titanic ship that a boarded was 2 29 while max was 80

    2]Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard was max of 8 people

    3] while maximum Fare was 512 dollars

    4] while parent child boarded in titanic was range from with min (1) and max (8)
   
B] VISUALISATION

    1]No of people lost their life were more than 500+ out of which 'male' was the most as of we can say that female and children were rescued 1st -while only 300+ survived in the accident

    2]As people of 1st class has survived more in the incident as compare to that of 2nd and 3rd class people as 1st class have given first priority in boarding the rescue boat

    3]We can conclude that from data ticket price ranged from 0-75 dollar while maximum ticket sold was for 512 dollars, there were many tickets sold in between 75-300 dollar this may be extra charges of last-minute booking

    4] There were 5 such people having 8 sibling/spouses onboarded with them, while 606 were without any siblings

    5]There were more than 600+couple in the ship while couple having 1 child with them were 118 and so on
    
C] BUILDING MODEL

    By using try and error

       -we can conclude that the accuracy of the model by using [logistic Regression] model give the maximum accuracy=85%

       -while that of using [svm]=82%

       -And of [knn]=72%
RESULT-

 A] Before all the hyperparameter Tuning for LOGISTIC, KNN, SVM
       
       ACCURACY[KNN]==0.7219730941704036
       
       ACCURACY[LOGISTIC]==0.8430493273542601
       
       ACCURACY[SVM]==0.6502242152466368

  B] After all the hyperparameter Tuning for LOGISTIC, KNN, SVM
       
       ACCURACY[KNN]==0.726457399103139
       
       ACCURACY[LOGISTIC]==0.852017937219731
       
       ACCURACY[SVM]=0.8295964125560538
